# Login In Frontend
- Last two parts were about backend.
- Part 2 was last time we dealt with frontend.
    - Does not yet support user management that we did in backend in Part 4.
- The frontend just shows existing notes.
    - Cannot add new notes because of what we did in Part 4.
    - Backend expects a token verifying user's identity is sent with the new note.
    - We can change from important to not important.
- Being implementing user login.
- In this part, we assume new users will not be added from the frontend.
