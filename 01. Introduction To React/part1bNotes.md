# JavaScript

- Need to learn JS.
- Newest version is ECMAScript 2021 or ES12.
- Not all new JS version features are supported.
    - Needs to be transpiled to a lower JS version.
    - Most popular way is `Babel`.
    - Automatic in React apps created using `create-react-app`.
- `Node.js` is a JS runtime environment.
- Latest versions of Node already know latest versions of JS, so no transpilation needed.
- To run JS files with Node:
```
node <name_of_file>.js
```
- Can write JS code in Node console by typing `node`.
